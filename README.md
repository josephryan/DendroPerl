# DendroPerl
Port of DendroPy to Perl

### This is an attempt to port DendroPy to Perl
### Currently this is in very early stages and 
### I am doing this in my very spare spare time.
### There are more than 45,000 lines of code so this could take a while!

### I am trying to keep all of the variable and function names
### the same. Some exceptions to this are: 
###   1. __init__ functions for classes are "sub new" in Perl packages
###   2. Dictionary objects are turned to hashes
###   3. Tuple objects are turned to arrays
###   4. If references to arrays are used they are prefixed with $ra_
###   5. If references to hashes are used they are prefixed with $rh_

### I have not yet contacted the authors of DendroPy
### Because I'm not sure how feasible this will be.
### Once I've made some progress, I will reach out 
### to them.
