# DendroPerl
Port of DendroPy to Perl

### This is an attempt to port DendroPy to Perl
### Currently this is in very early stages and 
### I am doing this in my very spare spare time.

### I have not yet contacted the authors of DendroPy
### Because I'm not sure how feasible this will be.
### Once I've made some progress, I will reach out 
### to them.

### If you are interested in contributing to this project
### Please reach out to joseph.ryan@whitney.ufl.edu

### While this is in early stages of developement,
### DO NOT USE ON REAL DATA

### Please observe the DendroPy license
### Use at your own risk
